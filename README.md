# Console-Finances
Creating code for analysing the financial records of a company

## Description 

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task in this challenge is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
